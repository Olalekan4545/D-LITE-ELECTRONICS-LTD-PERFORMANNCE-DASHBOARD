# D-LITE-ELECTRONICS-LTD-PERFORMANNCE-DASHBOARD
## Project Overview
This project analyzes 6 months of **Electronics Sales data** The analysis focuses on regional sales density in **Nigeria**, the goal was to transform raw sales data into an interactive decision-making tool that tracks  product profitability, peak Busiest Day trends, staff performance, customer value, and operational timing  to assist stakeholders in strategic decision-making.

##  Key Metrics & Visualizations
The Key Metrics are as Follows:
### **1. Product Intelligence**
* **Sales by Product Category:** Broad view of revenue drivers.
* **Product Name by Total Revenue:** Identifies the "High Value" products.
* **Product Name by Total Quantity Sold:** Highlights high-turnover inventory items.

### **2. Operational Efficiency**
* **The Busiest Day :**  this identifies the day of the week with the highest transaction volume.
* **Monthly Sales Trend:** Tracks the business pulse and seasonal growth.

### **3. Market & Team Performance**
* **Sales by Region:** Geographic performance across Nigeria.
* **Sales by Sales Rep:** A leaderboard tracking individual staff contributions.
* **Top 5 Customers by Revenue:** this identifies the customers that contributes most to the organisation

##  Tools
* **Excel/Xlxs:** Primary data source
* **Data Hosting:** Managed a single-table "Flat File" dataset efficiently within the Power Pivot environment.
* **Power Query (ETL):** Cleaned and transformed raw data, handled missing values, inconsistency, and standardized date formats.
* **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Developed measures for `Total Revenue`, `Total Quantity`, `Total order`, `Average order`, and `Total quantity sold`.
* **Excel Dashboards:** Utilized Slicers and Timelines for full user interactivity.

##  Data Insights
After analyzing the electronics sales data, the following key trends were uncovered:

* **Weekly Peak:** **Sunday** emerged as the highest volume day, contributing to approximately **127,300,000** of weekly revenue. This suggests a strong "end-of-week" buying culture for electronics.
* **Revenue Drivers:**  the **Laptop A15** Product had the highest quantity sold, while the  **Computer** Product category generated the most revenue, indicating a higher profit margin per unit.
* **Geographic Concentration:** Over **40% of total sales** are concentrated in the **East** Region, highlighting a massive opportunity for expansion in the underperforming Region like **North**.
* **Sales Force Efficiency:** The first 3  **Sales Representatives** are responsible for nearly **30% of total revenue**, suggesting that their sales techniques should be standardized across the team.

##  Actionable Business Recommendations
Based on the data visualized in this dashboard, here are the strategic recommendations for the management team:

###  1. Inventory & Stock Optimization
* **Capitalize on Peak Days:** Since **Sunday** records the highest sales volume, restocking and inventory audits should be completed by **Thursday** to ensure zero out-of-stock scenarios during the weekend rush.
* **Focus on "Star" Products:** Products like **Laptops** drive the most cash flow. Management should negotiate bulk-purchase discounts with suppliers for these specific items to increase profit margins.

###  2. Sales Team & CRM Strategy
* **Incentivize Top Performers:** The **Sales by Rep** visual shows a significant performance gap. I recommend a mentorship program where the top 3 reps share their closing techniques with the rest of the team.
* **VIP Loyalty Program:** The **Top 5 Customers** contribute a disproportionate amount of revenue. Implementing a "Gold Tier" loyalty program for these specific clients could increase retention and lifetime value.

###  3. Regional Expansion
* **Geographic Targeting:** Sales are currently concentrated in **East Region**. Data suggests an untapped opportunity in **North**. A targeted marketing campaign or a new "Pick-up Station" in this area could drive geographic diversification.

###  4. Pricing Strategy
* **High Volume vs. High Value:** Comparison between **Quantity Sold** and **Total Revenue** indicates that some categories have high turnover but low margins. I recommend a slight price optimization or "Bundling Strategy" (e.g., selling a case with every phone) to increase the Average Order Value (AOV).
